I think it is mainly aimed at Germans driving through a part of Tirol in Austria. But it is a great exercise. \"In a train to Tirol\" would be an obvious translation that a normal translator would be tempted to use. But it would lose that wonderful wordplay and turn a very clever strapline into something completely flat.</p>\n<p>But what could we use instead?</p>",

There are a lot of voices out there and if you are trying to sell something you need to grab and hold attention. But you already know that. Of course you do. And I bet you take a lot of care to get the source text right in the original language. That's easy for you to do if the source language is your language. But what about the English translation? Are you sure that you are as sensitive to what might be wrong with that? Be very careful here, because sometimes the translation can look good to you because you recognize each element from the source. BUT, those elements may be completely meaningless in the English-speaking world. In fact, sometimes the translation that looks best to a native speaker of the source language is the hardest to understand for a native speaker of the target language. How can you know what is right?</p>",
