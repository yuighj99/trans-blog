                <p>Well, it is good for some things. It's good for email exchanges or translating on the fly out of another language into yours. Situations where all parties concerned know that they will need to work a little to understand what is meant, and where it is acceptable that some things won't be immediately clear (or may even be completely unclear).</p>

                <p>Transcreation is a word we hear quite often these days, but maybe the term "localization copywriting" is a little more self-explanatory. Call it what you like, it is the process of not just translating text but rewriting a message in another language and, where necessary, adapting it culturally.</p>

        <title>Would you translate this as &quot;In a train to Tirol&quot;?</title>

                <p>I have seen this sign many times and always admired the excellent wordplay. As far as I know there is no English version, and I don't think there needs to be. I think it is mainly aimed at Germans driving through a part of Tirol in Austria. But it is a great exercise. "In a train to Tirol" would be an obvious translation that a normal translator would be tempted to use. But it would lose that wonderful wordplay and turn a very clever strapline into something completely flat.</p>
<p>But what could we use instead?</p>
