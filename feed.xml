                <p>Well, it is good for some things. It's good for email exchanges or translating on the fly out of another language into yours. Situations where all parties concerned know that they will need to work a little to understand what is meant, and where it is acceptable that some things won't be immediately clear (or may even be completely unclear).</p>

                <p>Transcreation is a word we hear quite often these days, but maybe the term "localization copywriting" is a little more self-explanatory. Call it what you like, it is the process of not just translating text but rewriting a message in another language and, where necessary, adapting it culturally.</p>

        <title>Would you translate this as &quot;In a train to Tirol&quot;?</title>

                <p>I have seen this sign many times and always admired the excellent wordplay. As far as I know there is no English version, and I don't think there needs to be. I think it is mainly aimed at Germans driving through a part of Tirol in Austria. But it is a great exercise. "In a train to Tirol" would be an obvious translation that a normal translator would be tempted to use. But it would lose that wonderful wordplay and turn a very clever strapline into something completely flat.</p>
<p>But what could we use instead?</p>

                <p>Your marketing copy must be crystal clear or it risks being ignored. There are a lot of voices out there and if you are trying to sell something you need to grab and hold attention. But you already know that. Of course you do. And I bet you take a lot of care to get the source text right in the original language. That's easy for you to do if the source language is your language. But what about the English translation? Are you sure that you are as sensitive to what might be wrong with that? Be very careful here, because sometimes the translation can look good to you because you recognize each element from the source. BUT, those elements may be completely meaningless in the English-speaking world. In fact, sometimes the translation that looks best to a native speaker of the source language is the hardest to understand for a native speaker of the target language. How can you know what is right?</p>
