As far as I know there is no English version of this ad, and I don't think there needs to be one. I'm pretty sure it is aimed primarily at German visitors to Tirol in Austria.</p><p>I'm going to try to transcreate it into English anyway, just for fun, and as a quick example of the transcreation process.</p><p>Right. What's the message?<br>- We encourage you to go to Tirol by train instead of by car<br>- You can go directly, even from Germany</p><p>The word-for-word translation "In a train to Tirol" is, of course, not a proper translation. It doesn't even transfer one of the two elements of the message contained in the German wordplay. In fact, in English it comes across as no more than a fairly pointless statement. It just hangs in the air. A normal translator might still be tempted to use it though. You can understand why if you remember that regular, jobbing translators are mostly paid per word, and as little per word as the customer or agency can get away with. On top of that, they are usually not provided with the context needed to do a proper job</p><p>It is clear that what makes the message stick in your head is the excellent wordplay. It reverberates in the mind. Can we find an equivalent in English? Well, although you could translate the German expression "in einem Zug" into English as "in one fell swoop" or "(all) in one go", neither is usable in this context.</p><p>Oh dear.</p><p>If we don't have a wordplay, what can we do instead that would be similar in its effect on the reader?</p><p>We could use a different literary device. Alliteration, for example, rather than wordplay. I have one idea. I don't like it as much as the source, but it would work, and, importantly, it is usable for the intended purpose, and it contains both elements of the message:</p><p>"Take the train straight to Tirol"</p><p>Maybe if a driver saw that a few times on a stretch of road (there are several of these ads on billboards placed along certain sections of trunk road), it might start off a brainworm (a brainworm is my own term for something that gets stuck in your head a bit like an earworm, except that it's a phrase rather than a piece of music). Hmm... I'm starting to like it more. If you say it a few times to yourself, the rhythm starts to sound like a train clacking along the track.</p><p>It's good to like your own ideas... but not too much!</p><p>If you are from the company Tirol Info, then I would like to say that you have my sincere admiration for a great strapline in German. And although my English version is probably not quite as good, I still claim copyright to it. So if you want to use it, please get in touch first.</p><p>And whoever you are, if you can think of something better, I'd love to know what it is. Just out of interest.</p><p>So, there's a quick and real example of what transcreation is all about. And it <em>is</em> rather fun, isn't it?</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://mpt24.com/authors/author1/" class="invert" rel="author">Author1</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with over 20 years experience in translation, localization and transcreation.
