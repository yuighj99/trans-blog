As far as I know there is no English version, and I don't think there needs to be. I think it is mainly aimed at Germans driving through a part of Tirol in Austria. But it is a great exercise. "In a train to Tirol" would be an obvious translation that a normal translator would be tempted to use. But it would lose that wonderful wordplay and turn a very clever strapline into something completely flat.</p><p>But what could we use instead?</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://mpt24.com/authors/manko-pie/" class="invert" rel="author">Manko Pie</a></h3><p>I am a freelance translator with over 20 years experience in translation, localization and transcreation.
